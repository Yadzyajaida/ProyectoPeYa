# **App Name**: XLSX Processor

## Core Features:

- Products File Processing: Process the 'productos' file: removes columns, validates data types, handles duplicate SKUs, removes headers, and converts to CSV UTF-8.
- Optional File Processing: Process the 'opcionales' file: fills empty cells in specified columns based on given conditions, removes columns, validates data types, removes headers, and converts to CSV UTF-8.
- XLSX File Upload: Enable users to upload .xlsx files for processing.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#77B5FE) to create a calm and reliable feel.
- Background color: Very light blue (#EBF4FA), close to white.
- Accent color: Light green (#B2BEB5) for key actions like uploading or downloading, for an impression of successful file transfers.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, to achieve a clean, objective look.
- Clean, minimalist layout to emphasize functionality. The layout should guide the user through uploading, processing, and downloading files easily.
- Use clear, recognizable icons for file upload and download actions.
- Subtle progress animations while files are being processed, to indicate activity without distracting the user.
